Hello World example
===================

This is the "Hello World" example for the RevHttpWs proxy server.

The helloWorld.html contains two parts:

* the server part which registers a domain on a revhttpws server and attaches a simple HTTP handler for the domain
* the client part which sends a XHR request to the newly registered domain and injects the received response into the page HTML

See [the code for helloWorld.html](https://github.com/izuzak/node-revhttpws/blob/master/examples/hello-world/helloWorld.html) for more info.
