RevHttpWs Examples
==================

Here you can find several examples/demos of using revhttpws:
* [Hello World](https://github.com/izuzak/node-revhttpws/blob/master/examples/hello-world/) - the simplest possible example of creating a HTTP server using revhttpws. You can also view the example at: [http://jsbin.com/opadu4/2](http://jsbin.com/opadu4/2)
* [PubSubHubBub + WebNotifications](https://github.com/izuzak/node-revhttpws/blob/master/examples/pshb-webnotif/) - an example of subscribing to and publishing [PubSubHubBub](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/) feed notifications using revhttpws HTTP servers. Essentially, this example shows how revhttpws can be used to enable browsers to generate and receive real time notifications by creating a pshb publisher and subscriber in the browser. If available, the [WebNotifications API](http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebNotifications/publish/Notifications.html) is used to display the received notifications.
